# Encrypting and Decrypting a Dynamic Library

## Overview

This is a personal test to explore how to encrypt a dynamic library and then decrypt it before using it in an application. The goal is to understand the process of securing library code and ensuring it can be safely loaded at runtime.

### Key Points

- The dynamic library will be encrypted to protect its contents.
- Before using the library, it will be decrypted in memory.
